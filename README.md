# README for Cats & Dogs Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a binary classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. Two models are built and evaluated:
1. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
2. A fine-tuned VGG16 pre-trained model from ImageNet.

The project includes steps for data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs organized into training, validation, and test sets. These images vary in size and quality, making preprocessing a critical step.

## Steps Performed
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized image dimensions and samples from each category.
   - Identified outliers in image dimensions.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Images were resized to a fixed dimension (e.g., 150x150).
   - Pixel values were normalized.

3. **Model Development:**
   - A custom CNN model with three convolutional layers and pooling layers.
   - A fine-tuned VGG16 model with frozen convolutional layers and additional dense layers for classification.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
   - Precision-recall curves for both models.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Loss and accuracy plots.
   - Visualization of misclassified examples.

## Results
- **Custom CNN Model:** Accuracy ~50%.
- **VGG16 Model:** Accuracy ~50%.
- Observations:
  - Both models performed similarly, barely above random guessing.
  - Precision-recall curves showed sharp drops, indicating difficulty in distinguishing between classes.

## Suggested Improvements
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Standardize image dimensions and remove outliers.
  - Apply data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, zooming).

- **Model Architecture:**
  - Add dropout layers for regularization in the custom CNN.
  - Fine-tune the last few layers of VGG16 after freezing the earlier layers.

- **Training Techniques:**
  - Use a learning rate scheduler or SGD optimizer with momentum.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Include additional metrics like ROC-AUC.

These improvements can significantly enhance model performance and should be implemented in future iterations.
